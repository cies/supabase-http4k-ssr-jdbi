# This is our "version catalog", as Gradle calls it.
#
# It specifies all the versions and dependencies in a way that IntelliJ (and tools like Dependabot) can understand it.
# It is important to know that (as it says on the Gradle website:
# > A dependency catalog doesnâ€™t enforce the version of a dependency: like a regular dependency notation,
# > it declares the requested version or a rich version. That version is not necessarily the version that
# > is selected during conflict resolution.
# In other words: if you really want to narrow versions down (which is a good idea), you need to use `strictly` (see
# `jacksonVersion) for individual dependencies, or version locking for the project as a whole:
